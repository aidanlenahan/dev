            My intrest for technology mostly sparked from one thing--Cyberpatiot. I have been doing Cyberpatriot since sixth grade. I am now a junior at Red Bank Regional and a member of the IT adacemy. Throughout the years, I have learned an abundance of information from peers, mentors, coaches, online videos, blogs like this one, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
	    In this blog post, I will outline what I have learned, the recources I have gathered, and the recources I myself have made.
        </p>

        <h2>Middle School</h2>
        <p>
            Starting in sixth grade, I have participated in Cyberpatriot. Of course, when first starting, I was completely clueless. Thankfully, I was apart of a team of two others: let's call them Jack and Al. Jack specialized in Windows. He was very good at the Forensics Questions and getting rid of backdoors. Al specialized in Linux, which I didn't understand one bit. The prevalence of the command line was intimidating, but Al was good at it.
	</p>
	<p>
	    I was assigned the only image left: Windows Server. It wasn't too bad. If I had any questions, I could ask Jack and he would do a pretty good job with answering since Windows and Server are relatively similar.
        </p>
	<p>
	    I did average on Windows Server. I understood most of the concepts thrown at me, but only earned around 40-50 points in round 1 my first year. Although our team was relatively knowledgeable, we weren't very focused. We watched Youtube videos and Rickrolled each other during practices and even competitions. In hindsight, middle school students have a very small attention span.
