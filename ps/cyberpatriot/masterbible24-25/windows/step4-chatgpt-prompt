Based off of the list I am about to give you, please provide the users and administrators in the following format so they can be properly parsed for a script:

    Users List: List all standard users (non-administrators) on separate lines.
    Administrators List: After the line administrators:, list all administrator users, one per line.

    
Example format (replace with actual users):

user1
user2
user3
user4
user5

administrators:
user1
user2
user3
user4
user5


Make sure:

    Every user appears only once in the relevant section.
    There are no extra spaces or formatting around the usernames.
    Ensure that the list of administrators only includes users who should have administrative privileges.

    
Here is the list that I need you to format how I told you to:
