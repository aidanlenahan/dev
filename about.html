            In this blog, I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences with technology. This includes topics like programming, cybersecurity, networking, Linux, selfhosting, and more. I also might talk about any engineering projects I tackle.
          I'll try to post one blog post every two weeks, but the frequency might change depending on my availability.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a junior in high school. I prioritize family, education, technology, and music.
            <br>Along with my interest in technology, I also run varsitiy cross country and participate in school track and club lacrosse.
            I've been running for six years now and have played lacrosse for around a decade. Just last year, I was invited to my club national team, where I played a tournament with other national players.
            <br>I have also loved music ever since I can remember. I've played piano for a bit longer than a decade now, playing pieces ranging from classic rock to modern classical pieces. A few of my most recent songs have been 
            Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, Don't Stop Believin' by Journey, Idea 15 by Gibran Alcocer, Toes by Zac Brown Band, Blackbird by The Beatles, and All You Need is Love by The Beetles.
            <br>I also have a dog walking business that I've had since 2021. My client count has grown to about 20 now. It's a nice way to get some extra money while also enjoying spending time with dogs.
            <br>Due to my expertise in technology, during the Cyberpatriot season, I tend to mentor at my middle school's Cyberpatriot program. This helps me and them since I'm increasing my exposure to the content, and helps them because
            they have someone closer to their age that they can relate to and are in some cases more teachable.
